# DragonBoatLineup
A tool to help you generate the lineup for a dragon boat event

TO RUN:
  Open any of the html files with a browser.  


Stuff to work on: html, css, and js folders'

html:
  generator.html: Lineup builder page.  Uses a lot of functions from js/functions.js.  Really complicated algorithm for the autogenerate feature.  
  
  index.html: splash page, could use some zazz
  
  signup.html: Signup page, needs more features like forgot password, better UI, etc.
  
  paddlers.html: Roster page.  Functionally works, but some things can be improved.  Some times it accesses the database when it doesn't necessarily have to.  
  
  
js: 
  functions.js: Functions used in the generator.html file mostly.  Can definitely be cleaned up / reorganized.
